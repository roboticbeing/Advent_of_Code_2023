# ❄️ Day 1 Reflection ❄️

## Part 1 & 2
Oh gosh, it feels like it's been a while since I've touched Python. I've got to relearn it and retrain my brain to think like a snake! 🐍

## What I've Learned
startswith() is a very nice function that searches for a string within a string - and it doesn't have to start with it.
```python
  if line[i:].startswith(val):
```
splitlines() is a nice trick so that I don't have to write out split('\n')
